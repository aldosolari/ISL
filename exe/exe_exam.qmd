### Written Exam – Introductory Statistical Learning with R

**Duration:** 90 minutes  
**Format:** In-class, individual  
**Resources:** Open book, open internet  
**Submission:** Moodle course webpage  
**Passing score:** 18 / 30  

---

### Objective

Build a predictive model using the provided training data and generate predictions for a test set.

No exploratory analysis, plots, interpretation, or written report is required.  
The exam focuses on **predictive performance and reproducibility**.

---

### Data

Download from the course webpage:

- `train.csv` — training data (response included)  
- `test.csv` — test data (response removed)  
- `starter.Rmd` — starter file with a baseline model  

The baseline model produces a valid submission.

---

### Task

1. Fit one or more predictive models using the training data.  
2. Improve upon the baseline model.  
3. Generate predictions for all rows in `test.csv`.  
4. Submit the required files on Moodle before the deadline.

You may use any regression method covered in the course.

### Deliverables (exactly two files)

**1. `STUDENTID.Rmd`**
- Code only (no text, no plots)  
- Commented code  
- Runs top-to-bottom without intervention  
- Sets a random seed  
- Reproduces the prediction file  
- Includes `sessionInfo()`

**2. `STUDENTID_predictions.csv`**
- One column only: `y_pred`  
- No row names, no extra columns  
- Generated by the R Markdown file  

Submissions that do not reproduce the prediction file when run receive **zero points** for the written exam.

---

### Rules

- Individual work only; collaboration is not allowed.  
- You may use the textbook and online resources.  
- You are responsible for all submitted work, regardless of how it was obtained.  
- Datasets must not be modified.  
- File names and formats must match exactly.  
- The exam duration is strictly 90 minutes.

### Grading

**Written exam: 0–30 points (18 = pass)**


The written score is based on test-set prediction accuracy and reproducibility.

Prediction accuracy is evaluated relative to a baseline model and to the best
submitted model using the following normalization:

$$
\text{Normalized score} =
\frac{\text{score} - \text{baseline}}
     {\text{best} - \text{baseline}}
$$

The normalized score is then mapped to the 0–30 scale.

The oral exam verifies understanding and theoretical knowledge and may adjust the
written score.

### Oral Exam

A short individual oral exam follows the written exam.

During the oral exam, students may be asked to:

- explain modeling choices and preprocessing steps;  
- explain, modify, or extend parts of their submitted code;  
- answer theoretical questions related to the course.

Inability to explain the submitted work or basic theory may result in a score adjustment or failure.
